## Welcome to my app

Daniel Alejandro Florez Ospina

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can run this in development by running the command "npm start"

If you want to run this in production in an static server you can run "npm run build", then run "npm install -g serve" and finally "serve -s build" the application must be in 
[ http://localhost:5000 ](http://localhost:5000)   


## Considerations on solving the problem
I spent two days working on this project and I found it really fun, my approach to this problem 
was segmenting the requirements in smaller user stories like, showing the shopping cart, manege the local storage 
for the cart, show the menu, show the items on a subcategory, filtering by name and other tasks like those.

I have to say that my work experience is mostly in Back-End development but I really enjoy using some frameworks like React.
 
Even though I had some problems with the given JSON of categories and its relation with the JSON of 
products, I think that not always the data we use is in the expected structure. So finding out a way
to solve the problems that we encounter is of real value.

Finally if you have any comments, feel free to make an issue or send me an email. 
Thanks.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
